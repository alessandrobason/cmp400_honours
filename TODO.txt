[X] Mouse input texture
[X] Object material
[X] Save to / Load from file
[ ] Antialiasing
[ ] Make normal map 3d texture, so the normal calculation

[X] Brush UI
[ ] Key remapping
[X] Background image
[ ] If you hold shift, a bar appears over the mouse for changing the size,
    could have the same thing with the ctrl key and the alt key for depth and
    smoothness
[ ] make GPUTimer handle-based (look at half-implemented version in timer.h)

-- Options ideas --
* texture format (either f16 or f32)
* volume tex size
* brush tex size
