[X] Key remapping
[X] add "new" button in file, where we can create a new scene, let the user decide if it should have a default shape (sphere, maybe more?) in it
[X] support sizes that are not constant (not all values are the same)
[X] load background image from file
[ ] If you hold shift, a bar appears over the mouse for changing the size,
    could have the same thing with the ctrl key and the alt key for depth and
    smoothness
[ ] Make normal map 3d texture, so the normal calculation
    becomes only 8 texture lookups instead of 32 (jesus christ)
[ ] use a debug allocator that checks for memory leaks
[ ] Antialiasing
[ ] make GPUTimer handle-based (look at half-implemented version in timer.h)

[ ] help screen with all the controls
[X] use SDF box in brush
[X] hot-reload material texture
[X] add default brushes
[ ] fix weird UV issues
[X] move saving to another thread
[ ] camera with panning
[ ] render rt stuff in normal mode (maybe even lights?)

[X] investigate better sculpting

[ ] when user makes a change and hasn't saved, change window name to "filename *"

-- For ADGS --
[ ] add ray tracing UI
[ ] get C00L screenshots

-- Already Done --
[X] Mouse input texture
[X] Object material
[X] Save to / Load from file
[X] Compress file on save
[X] Load brush from file
[X] Brush UI
[X] Background image
[X] options UI
[X] sculpting
[X] "view" menu that lets you open/close any window
[X] add percentage of file size when compressing it

-- Options ideas --
* texture format (either f16 or f32)
* volume tex size
* brush tex size
