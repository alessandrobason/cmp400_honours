[X] Mouse input texture
[X] Object material
[X] Save to / Load from file
[X] Compress file on save
[X] Load brush from file
[ ] Antialiasing
[ ] Make normal map 3d texture, so the normal calculation
    becomes only 8 texture lookups instead of 32 (jesus christ)
[X] Brush UI
[ ] Key remapping
[X] Background image
[ ] If you hold shift, a bar appears over the mouse for changing the size,
    could have the same thing with the ctrl key and the alt key for depth and
    smoothness
[ ] make GPUTimer handle-based (look at half-implemented version in timer.h)
[ ] when user makes a change and hasn't saved, change window name to "filename *"

[X] options UI
[ ] load background image from file
[ ] sculpting
[X] "view" menu that lets you open/close any window
[ ] support sizes that are not constant (not all values are the same)
[ ] add "new" button in file, where we can create a new scene, let the user decide if it should have a default shape (sphere, maybe more?) in it
[X] add percentage of file size when compressing it

-- Options ideas --
* texture format (either f16 or f32)
* volume tex size
* brush tex size
