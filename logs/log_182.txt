[ERROR](00:00:0090): ID3D11DeviceContext::Begin: Begin is not supported and cannot be invoked for the D3D11_QUERY, 2.
[WARN] (00:00:0090): ID3D11DeviceContext::End: Begin is supported on this Query/ Predicate/ Counter; but Begin was not invoked before End. This is valid; but unusual. It is equivalent to invoking End immediately after a Begin.
[ERROR](00:00:0090): couldn't get end data
[ERROR](00:00:0090): ID3D11DeviceContext::GetData: GetData is being invoked on a Query/ Predicate/ Counter, after invoking Begin, but not yet after End. The range of commands must be completed by invoking End, before invoking GetData.
