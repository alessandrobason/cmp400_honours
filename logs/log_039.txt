[WARN] (00:00:0266): ID3D11DeviceContext::CSSetUnorderedAccessViews: Resource being set to CS UnorderedAccessView slot 0 is still bound on input!
[WARN] (00:00:0267): ID3D11DeviceContext::CSSetUnorderedAccessViews: Forcing PS shader resource slot 0 to NULL.
[WARN] (00:00:0267): ID3D11DeviceContext::Dispatch: The size of the Constant Buffer at slot 0 of the Compute Shader unit is too small (16 bytes provided, 32 bytes, at least, expected). This is OK, as out-of-bounds reads are defined to return 0. It is also possible the developer knows the missing data will not be used anyway. This is only a problem if the developer actually intended to bind a sufficiently large Constant Buffer for what the shader expects.
